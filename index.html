                <p>Jason Saenz was born and raised in Houston, Texas, where he did some things and had some experiences. After
                    he graduated from high school, he wandered around Texas, attending various universities, and working
                    during the summers as a river and hiking guide in Alaska. He ultimately graduated from Houston Baptist
                    University with a double major in professional writing and mass communication. </p>

                <p>Even before graduation, Jason began a position as a copy editor for the Times-News in Twin Falls, Idaho.
                    After moving back to his hometown, he worked as a copywriter for various oil and gas companies’ marketing
                    departments. Unsatisfied with his job, Jason decided to move full-time to Juneau, Alaska, where he worked
                    for the Boy Scouts of America as a district executive of Southeast Alaska. He explored the beautiful
                    islands of the region while running the area’s day-to-day operations.
                </p>

                <p>Despite his many adventures in the Last Frontier, Jason missed the mean, humid streets of Houston. He returned
                    to Texas and spent the next two years teaching high school English. Still unsatisfied, Jason discovered
                    a love for coding. And so here we are.
